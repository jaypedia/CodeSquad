# Operating system

## Before OS

Computers in the 1940s and early 50s ran one program at a time.

- A programmer would write one at their desk, for example, on punch cards.
- Then, they'd carry it to a room containing a room-sized computer, and hand it to a dedicated computer operator.
- That person would then feed the program into the computer when it was next available.
- The computer would run it, spit out some output, and halt.

This very manual process worked OK back when computers were slow, and running program often took hours, days or even weeks.
But computers became faster and faster. Pretty soon, having humans run around and inserting programs into readers was taking longer than running the actual programs themselves.

We needed a way for computers to operate themselves, and so operating systems were born.

## Operating systems are just programs

- Special privileges on the hardware let them run and manage other programs.
- **They're typically the first one to start when a computer is turned on, and all subsequent programs are launched by the OS.**
- They got their start in the 1950s, as computers became more widespread and more powerful.
- The very first OSes augmented the mundane, manual task of loading programs by hand.

### Batch processing

- Instead of being given one program at a time, computers could be given batches.
- When the computer was done with one, it would automatically and near-instanly start the next.
- There was no downtime while someone scurried around an office to find the next program to run.

- But as computers became more widespread, their configurations were not always identical.
  - like computers might have the same CPU, but not the same printer.
  - This was a huge pain for programmers. Not only did they have to worry about writing their program, but also how to interface with each and every model of printer, and all devices connected to a computer, what are called **peripherals**.
