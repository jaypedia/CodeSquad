## What is OOP?

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **"objects"**

  - Object can contain data and code
    - data in the form of fields (often known as attribute or properties)
    - code in the form of procedures (often known as methods)

- In OOP, we combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit(object).
  - variable -> property
  - function -> method

## Before OOP - Procedural programming

- In procedural programming, program is divided into a set of functions.
  - Data is stored in a bunch of variables and functions operate on the data.
  - This style of programming is very simple and straightforward.
- There is so much **interdependency between all these functions**.
  - It becomes problematic!
  - OOP came to solve this problem.

## Main principles of OOP

### 1. Encapsulation

- All important information is contained inside an object and only selected information is exposed.
- Using encapsulation, we group related variables and functions together, and this way we can reduce complexity.
- The best functions are those with no parameters! - Robert C Martin
  - The fewer the number of parameters, the easier it is to use and maintain that function.

### 2. Abstraction

- Hide the details and the complexity, and show only the essentials!
- We can hide some of the properties and methods from the outside, and this gives us a couple of benefits.
  1. We'll make the interface of those objects simpler.
  2. It helps us reduce(isolate) the impact of change.

### 3. Inheritance

- Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code.

### 4. Polymorphism

- 'poly' means 'many', 'morph' means 'form'.
- In OOP, polymorphism is a technique that allows you to get rid of `switch case` statements.

## Benefits of OOP

- code reusability
- scalability
- efficiency
